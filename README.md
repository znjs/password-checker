    <h1> Password Strength checker</h1>
</div>

## In this question, you need to build a password strength checker in React.js that shows the strength of the password (out of 10) and a progress bar where the progress is determined by the strength. It is a good beginner-friendly question to practice for Machine Coding Round. Some points to remember

## Password's length should be between 6 and 32 characters

## Strength of the password is a combination of its length and the type of characters in the password.

## The max strength possible is 10.

- If the password has at least one uppercase letter then strength increases by 1.
- If the password has at least one lowercase letter then strength increases by 1.
- If the password has at least one digit then strength increases by 1.
- If the password has at least one special character then strength increases by 1.
- If strength > 3 && strength <= 6 then password is considered to be weak.
- If strength > 6 && strength <= 8 then password is considered to be moderate.
- If strength > 8 then the password is considered to be strong.
- If the password length is less than 3 then strength should be considered as 0.
